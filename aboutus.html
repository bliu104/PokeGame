        <p7>Q4: How is PokéAssist built?</p7>
        <br /><br />
        <p8
          >Answer: Good Question! PokéAssist is built with HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript! With Axios to consume data from an external source, and
          render that data into the DOM! Sounds exciting! But theres more! It
          uses flexbox and grid to format the page however I please! You ask
          will it look good on your mobile device like phones and tablets? My
          answer is, good is subjective! it will look! It will also be hosted on
          surge so that everyone could give it a try!</p8
