Title: PokeAssist
Description: PokeAssist is a Pokemon index where you can get basic information of your favorite pokemon. It includes a turn-based battling system where two pokemon battles until one wins. This is fun little game where you get a randomize pokemon to battle, and the best part is that all the moves are randomized!!! But you could pick your own pokemon!
API: The API used is the PokeAPI
The App is built with Javascript, CSS and HTML using axios to extract data from PokeAPI, for the Data organization, I used Grid. This app work with all mediaqueries, however, it is optimal with computers. This will be hosted on surge.
